# Amoeba: Subsidiary Search and Corp Intel

> Amoebas eat algae, bacteria, plant cells, and microscopic protozoa and metazoa â€“ some amoebas are parasites. They eat by surrounding tiny particles of food with pseudopods, forming a bubble-like food vacuole. The food vacuole digests the food.


It is surprisingly complex to get a quick answer to the question of what subsidiaries does even a _public_ company own. There are several companies that have created paid products to aggregate corporate information, and do a good job of providing access to their paid API. 

_"Where you must go; where the path of the One ends."_

Most (or some?) of the data can be accessed for free from SEC EDGAR portal, if you are willing to dive deep into scraping :) (more on challenges later). 
Amoeba shaves some minutes/hours from operator's time by providing tool assisted retrieval of data to answer the question of corporate subsidiary search.  

## Finding Corporation Entity w/SEC EDGAR

**Problem**: Need to find a corporation CIK number. We have the name of the entity.
> The Central Index Key or CIK is a 10-digit number used on the Securities and Exchange Commission's computer systems to identify corporations and individuals who have filed disclosure with the SEC

**Solution**: Find the CIK by the exact name known to us:
```
$ ./amoeba.py edgar -O find-corp-name -n "important data corp"
IMPORTANT CORP CORP:0000994980
```

**Problem:** However, sometimes we don't know the official name used for SEC registration. Let's say we only know part of the name.


```
$ ./amoeba.py edgar -O find-corp-name -n "IMPORTANT data"
Error:  'IMPORTANT CORP'
```
We may need to find similar sounding corps and then choose the right one.

**Solution** Let's `fuzzy` search the corporations:

```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O find-corps-names -N "Important Corp" -N "ImportantCorp"
IMPORTANT CORP AVIATION LLC:0001442062
IMPORTANT CORP CAPITAL, INC.:0001442061

```

**Problem** : How do we know which one is the correct one?
**Solution** : Let's get some pointers on the entities to help us decide

## Searching for Corporation subsidiaries w/SEC EDGAR
We need to have some tools to be able to find corporate subsidiaries. The list may fluctuate as companies acquire or merge with others.

There are over 338 _Types_ of filing forms developed by SEC, and these forms have at least 40 types of _Exhibits_ to go with the forms. Not every company uses all, not every company uses the right ones, not every company discloses appropriate information due to variations in legal structure of subsidiaries, not every parent company is US-based and registered with SEC. 

Let's take the most common scenario when a Corporation is registered in the US, and discloses it's subsidiaries. 

### SEC filing and Exhibit 21.X 
The preferred way to disclose ownership of a subsidiary by a corporation is to find the company's 10-K filing and locate their _Exhibit 21_ (or `EX-21.X`) form. This document should list the names of subsidiaries and their incorporation state and operating locations.

_Note_: SEC forms formats are not consistent and have mutated over the years. This is also true for the exhibits. Most of the newer submissions are done with XRBL format but the submissions are not consistent and there is arguably limited structure to retrieve the exhibit data.

**Problem** Where are the _EX-21.X_? And how do we get them?

**Solution A**: We can locate and download documents from SEC.GOV EDGAR Database by doing web scraping of the data posted in their portal. Due to the issues with formatting, it may be a preferred method to assist the analyst with data retrieval.

**Solution B**: We can enable realtime retrieval of different types of Filings and perform a pattern search across the data. This is useful when the company does not disclose it's subsidiaries in one place (EX-21.X) but refer to acquisitions in their other documents filed with SEC. This method is a lot more fuzzy, and more involved but may augment analyst's research efforts when the pickings are slim. For example, _EX-99.X_ documents may disclose such news. 

### Solution A: EX-21 document retrieval

```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-K -y EX-21 -d

This retrieves `EX-21.*` documents from SEC and stores them locally for the manual review. This does not search for patterns as it assumes the exhibit is the pure list of subsidiaries owned by the corporation and disclosed in SEC filings. 

There are some shortcomings of the API, and scarping pagination is not supported yet. However you can retrieve historical documents by specifying the cutoff data to search from: 

```
$ ./amoeba.py edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-K -y EX-21 -b 20101010
```

Analyst can take the information obtained from the EX-21 documents and research the subsidiaries one by one. 


### Solution B: Filing form pattern search

The other mode is to be able to search for patterns across filing documents.
_Amoeba_ tool put in this mode is able to search across common filing types and exhibits.

```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-Q -y EX-21 -b 20000101  -P "aquire" -P "acquisition"
```

As we have mentioned before there is little structure to the disclosures for companies that do not fill out Ex-21. The patterns you specify and the types of filings you search in will determine the rate of success. 

To illustrate here we are performing multiple searches with various degrees of success.


Type: 10-Q
Subtype: EX-21
Patterns: "acquire", "acquisition"
Results: None.
```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-Q -y EX-21 -b 20000101  -P "aquire" -P "acquisition"
```
Type: 10-Q
Subtype: 10-Q
Patterns: "acquire", "acquisition"
Results: None.
```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-Q -y 10-Q -b 20000101  -P "aquire" -P "acquisition"
```

Type: 10-K
Subtype: EX-99
Patterns: "acquire", "acquisition"
Results: None.
```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-K -y EX-99 -b 20000101  -P "aquire" -P "acquisition"
```

Results: None.
```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-K -y EX-99   -P "fiserv"
```
Type: 10-K
Subtype: 10-K
Patterns: "fiserv"
Results: None.
```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 10-K -y 10-K   -P "fiserv"
```

Type: 425
Subtype: 425
Patterns: "acquire", "acquisition"
Results: Success (with manual review).
```
$ ./amoeba.py  edgar -O search-corp -c 0000994980 -t 425 -y 425   -P "acquire" -P "acquisition"
